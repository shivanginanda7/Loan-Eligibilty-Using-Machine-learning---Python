# Loan-Eligibilty-Using-Machine-learning-&-Python
# AIM
Our aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib python to extract insights from the data & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.
And in the end, to predict whether the loan applicant can repay the loan or not using multiple machine learning algorithms.
# Attributes in the dataset
Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status
# Model Used 
1.Support Vector Machine Model with Accuracy Score:82%
2.Decision Tree Classifier with Accuracy Score:69%
3.Naive Bayes Classifier with Accuracy Score:83%
# Observations
#Applicants who are graduate and have credit history have more applicant income.
#Again the applicants who are married and graduated have the more applicant income.
#Applicants who are male and are graduated have more applicant income over the applicants who have not graduated.
#Applicants with no dependents are maximum.
#Applicants who are not self employed have more applicant income than the applicants who are self employed.
